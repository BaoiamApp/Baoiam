          Course fee paid on LawSikho is not refundable as a general rule.

          We understand that it may be difficult for people new to the world of online learning to feel confident and fully understand the power of an online course or a career development program. Especially, when such a program requires extensive investment of time, energy, and money.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          What we can do here to allay such fears is to offer a money-back guarantee. Hence, we are introducing this refund policy as laid down in the following few paragraphs.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          If a student enrolls into a Diploma, Executive Certificate, Introductory, Remote International Work Courses, Foreign Bar Exam Courses or Degree Programs (LLM, MBA) course from LawSikho.com and after 30 days of usage, does not find any value in the course, then between the 30th day and 45th day counted from the day the course officially began, they can claim back the amount they have paid towards the course as a refund on the following condition:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Attended all the live online classes (in live mode only) in the first 30 days. Attendance in class also must be complete; for instance, if you attend a 60 min class for only 30 minutes, it doesnâ€™t count as proper attendance. Watching a recording of the class does not qualify as attending the live class.
          </li>
          <li>
            He/she must have submitted all the assignments issued within the first 30 days successfully. The submissions have to be on time and meet the standards of the course.
          </li>
